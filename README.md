# Machine_Learning_Seattle_Prices

I analyzed Seattle House Prices using Pandas and Scikit Learn Library.

The dataset was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction.

Linear Regression Model was used to make prediction on house prices.

Also, the many of the techniques was obtained from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.

It was a relatively simple project since it was my first data science project.
